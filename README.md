# discord-bot

## Getting started with development
You'll need a discord bot if you want to do any manual testing, to do that I'd recommend creating your own discord server to use.
Then visit this page https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new bot.
Then follow this tutorial (its short) https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html
The bot will have a token that you can copy paste, you use that whenever you run the bot program.

Now install `go`, you'll need at least version 1.16.

A couple things you'll need for development
```
go build main.go     <-- compiles your code
go run main.go       <-- compiles and runs your code
```
